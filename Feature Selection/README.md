### Feature Selection
feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for several reasons
* Simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users,
* Shorter training times,
* To avoid the curse of dimensionality,
* Enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting[2] (formally, reduction of variance)
