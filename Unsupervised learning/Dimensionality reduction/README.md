## Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction or dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. 
Approaches can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

#### Advantages of dimensionality reduction

1. It reduces the time and storage space required.
2. Removal of multi-collinearity improves the interpretation of the parameters of the machine learning model.
3. It becomes easier to visualize the data when reduced to very low dimensions such as 2D or 3D.
4. It avoids the curse of dimensionality.
